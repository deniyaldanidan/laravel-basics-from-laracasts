This is a lesson i learned from laracasts

Right Now the best method for me is to:
	- Use Route and direct every operations to the Controller-file
	- On Controller-File we'll do all the operations required and display it in a web-page using View-files
	- Model-file serves as a api to database queries
	- To manage [create|update] tables use migrations file
