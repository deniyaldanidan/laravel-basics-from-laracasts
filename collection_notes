To create a collections use:
	$collectionzx = collect(['one','two','three','four'])

if you have a nested array as below as a collection you can single it out like ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'] using ->flatten()
	$collectionzx1 = collect(['one', 'two', 'three', ['four', 'five']])

collections has so many methods and it is chainable like below
	$collectionzx2 = collect([1,2,3,4,5,6,[7,8,9]])
	$collectionzx2->flatten()->filter(function($x){return $x>=5;})->map(function($y){return $y**2;})->filter(function($z){return $z%2==0;})->first()
	above code will return 36

To return a Model-collections with relationship result use  [---Most USEFUL ONE---]
	$articles = App\Models\Article::with('tag')->get(); 
	here Model.Article is linked many to many relationship with Model.tag we fetched all the articles with the taags associated with as a single collection

To get all the unique tags in the retrieved blogs use
	$articles->pluck('tag')->collapse()->pluck('name')->unique()
		or use
	$articles->pluck('tag.*.name')->collapse()->unique()
	
	to capitaize the results use below
	$articles->pluck('tag.*.name')->collapse()->unique()->map(function($x){return ucwords($x);})
